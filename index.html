                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Product Information</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Our WIY Winch Mount Kit is purpose-built for 1st Gen Toyota Tundras and Sequoias. Engineered for strength and DIY adaptability, this kit includes everything needed to weld and install a custom winch plate behind your stock or aftermarket bumper. Made from heavy-duty steel, the components are CNC cut and shipped raw allowing for full customization and integration with your existing bumper setup.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>It’s designed to sit snugly between the frame rails and bolt directly to them using the provided mounting plates, ensuring a secure and solid recovery anchor point. The low-profile design maintains airflow to your radiator while positioning the winch for optimal pulling power and front-end reinforcement.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Whether you're looking to upgrade your recovery game or just want a cleaner, more integrated setup, this kit makes it easy to run a winch without replacing your entire bumper. It also serves as an excellent base for fabricators wanting to build their own front-end protection, bull bars, or custom bumper designs around a strong, pre-aligned winch platform.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Plus, because it’s a weld-it-yourself kit, it gives you total control over how it fits, looks, and functions. From mild trail rigs to hardcore overland builds, this winch mount adapts to your goals and your creativity.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Built for Strength, Designed for Flexibility</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>We built this kit with two things in mind: </span><span>reliability</span><span> and </span><span>adaptability</span><span>. Whether you're building a trail-ready beast or just want peace of mind on remote trips, this kit gives you the power of a winch without the hassle of a custom-fabricated solution from scratch.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>We’ve seen how challenging it can be to find winch mounting options for the 1st Gen Tundra and Sequoia platform. Most off-the-shelf bumpers either don’t come with winch plates or require costly fabrication work. Our kit bridges that gap, giving you everything you need in one box without compromising on strength or fit.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Complete DIY Kit with Precision-Cut Components</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>When you order our </span><span>WIY winch mount kit</span><span>, here’s what you’ll get:</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Laser-cut winch plate (3/16" steel)</span><span><br><br></span><span>CNC-bent side frame mounting brackets</span><span><br><br></span><span>Reinforcement gussets for added strength</span><span><br><br></span><span>Hardware mounting tabs (raw, unwelded for full DIY flexibility)</span><span><br><br></span><span>Mounting hole guides</span><span><br><br></span><span>Detailed visual layout to assist with mock-up and install</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Everything is raw steel, giving you complete freedom to weld, grind, and paint as needed for your build. It’s your rig, and this is your winch mount just the way you want it.</span></p>
                <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Made for Off-Roaders, Builders, and Everyday Explorers</span></h3>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>If you’re running a 1st Gen Tundra or Sequoia, and you take your vehicle off-road, overland, or into any terrain where recovery might be necessary, this winch mount is for you. It’s also ideal for fabricators and weekend builders who want to control the installation process and ensure a custom fit with their current bumper setup.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>This product isn’t just for hardcore wheelers, it's for any driver who values preparation, performance, and a solid front-end setup.
